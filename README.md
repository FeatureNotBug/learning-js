# Practice using javascript!

## Files:
- getTixInfo.js: given a departure date (right now needs to be manually changed in code), enter the data into the form on luckystarbus.com and take a screenshot of the result of form submission.

## Using:
- node v7.2.1
- npm v3.10.10
- phantomjs 1.9.0

## To run: 
- download the files
- run "npm i"
- run "npm install phantom --save"

1) getTixInfo.js
- run "phantomjs getTixInfo.js"

2) index.js
- run "npm install node-phantom"
- run "node index.js"


Goal: use phantomjs to scrape results for bus tickets from Lucky Star Bus to get screenshots of prices given departure/arrival dates and number of passengers.
